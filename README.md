# Medscreen-Missions-Data-Analysis
In this work we did a data analysis on data collected during a medical screening outreach at Konkonte-Kpetoe in Ghana.
Our findings were interesting and we hope it could be useful for other NGOs who would like to carry out similar outreaches in the Konkonte-Kpetoe district, Volta Region.
